# EigenLua

Lua 5.4 compiled onto [EigenScript](https://github.com/InauguralSystems/EigenScript). This is rung 1 of the
guest-language ladder: a front end turns Lua source into EigenScript, which runs on the real VM, so a Lua program
inherits EigenScript's observer, trace tape and sandbox.

It is graded against reference Lua 5.4.9 and the official Lua test suite. The bar and the gap ledger are in
[GAPS.md](GAPS.md).

Status: the grader is being built first. There is no front end yet.
